the trade of barter is as old as human history goes,
this portal is a small attempt to help us exchange or swap things,
that we need, for what we have with us.
There are a few categories to start with on the left ribbon,
look for the categories that might intrest you and connect with your
prospective barter partner by sending them a message.
And yes all this is alsolutely free!!!
